##Welcome to my airport dashboard project!!!

One feature that I added is the instructions button on the top left hand corner (Labeled "?"). For this, I used VueSweetalert2, and I import it in the third
line of my main.js file.

Please refer to my todo list attached in my email to you to see the features and tasks I would keep working to complete if I had more time to work on this.
